# Harmony Ecosystem - Separate-Then-Merge Strategy

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

Instead of building one massive "Harmony" platform, we're building **5 standalone products** that solve specific problems independently, then connecting them for compound value. This approach reduces risk, accelerates time-to-market, and creates multiple revenue streams.

## 📦 The 5 Product Suite

**Premium Expense Splitting Platform**
- **Directory:** `./teito/`
- **Primary Market:** Roommates, couples, shared households
- **Time to Build:** 2-3 months
- **Revenue Target:** $600K ARR (Year 1)
- **Key Innovation:** Receipt scanning + instant payment integration

### 2. 🔄 **CHOREWISE**
**Smart Household Task Management**
- **Directory:** `./chorewise/`
- **Primary Market:** Busy households wanting chore automation
- **Time to Build:** 3-4 months

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

- **Success Metric:** Each product reaches $50K+ MRR individually

### Phase 2: Smart Connections (Months 6-18)
- **Focus:** Create seamless integrations between products
- **Goal:** Compound value when products work together
- **Success Metric:** 40% higher retention for multi-product users

### Phase 3: Unified Platform (Months 12-24)

## 🎯 Why Start with Teito?

### 1. **Highest Market Validation**
- Splitwise's user-hostile pricing creates massive opportunity
- Clear value proposition: receipt scanning + instant payments
- Proven willingness to pay for expense management

### 2. **Shortest Time to Revenue**
- Simpler technical requirements than AI-heavy products
- Existing payment infrastructure (Plaid, Stripe, Venmo)
- Clear monetization path from day one

### 3. **Strategic Foundation**
- Financial data creates natural bridge to other household apps
- Expense patterns inform supply predictions (SupplySync)
- Payment disputes often trigger conflicts (PeaceKeeper)

## 🔗 Integration Architecture

### Data Sharing Strategy
```typescript
interface HouseholdData {
  // Shared across all products
  householdId: string;
  members: User[];
  preferences: HouseholdPreferences;
  
  // Product-specific data stays isolated
  expenses?: TeitoData;
  chores?: ChoreWiseData;
  supplies?: SupplySyncData;
  conflicts?: PeaceKeeperData;
  coordination?: HomeBaseData;
}
```

### Revenue Synergies
- **Teito → SupplySync:** Grocery receipt data improves consumption predictions
- **ChoreWise → PeaceKeeper:** Task completion patterns predict conflict triggers
- **PeaceKeeper → HomeBase:** Conflict risk informs scheduling decisions
- **All → HomeBase:** Unified dashboard commands premium pricing
