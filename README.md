## 🎯 Documentation Standards

We believe good docs are as important as good code:

- **Clear examples** - Every feature should have working code examples
- **Up-to-date** - Docs are updated with every release
- **Accessible** - Written for both beginners and experts
- **Visual** - Diagrams and screenshots where helpful

## 🤝 Contributing to Docs

Found something unclear? Want to add examples? We'd love your help!

1. Check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/avard-org/.github/blob/main/profile/CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidelines
2. For docs specifically:
   - Use clear, simple language
   - Include code examples
   - Test all examples before submitting
   - Follow the existing structure

## 📝 Writing Style

- **Conversational but professional** - Like explaining to a smart colleague
- **Action-oriented** - Start with verbs ("Create", "Configure", "Deploy")
- **Scannable** - Use headers, bullets, and code blocks
- **Inclusive** - Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
