## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **Avard** — a small studio with a big appetite for turning clever ideas into products that positively nudge everyday life.

### 🙋 What we’re about
* **Build fast, learn faster.** We ship functional prototypes in weeks, not months.  
* **Human > hype.** Tech should solve real problems and respect privacy, accessibility and sustainability.  
* **Community first.** Open-source what makes sense, share learnings, credit contributors.

---

### 🌈 How to get involved
1. **Browse our repos** — pick any issue labeled `good first issue` or `help-wanted`.  
2. **Create a fork → PR** — follow the commit-style guide in `/CONTRIBUTING.md`.  
3. **Join the discussion** — questions, ideas or feedback? Open a discussion thread.

We aim for inclusive, respectful collaboration — see our `/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
