## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **Avard** — a small studio with a big appetite for turning clever ideas into products that positively nudge everyday life.

---

### 🙋 What we're about
* **Build fast, learn faster.** We ship functional prototypes in weeks, not months.
* **Human > hype.** Tech should solve real problems and respect privacy, accessibility and sustainability.
* **Community first.** Open-source what makes sense, share learnings, credit contributors.

### 🌈 How to get involved
1. **Browse our repos** — pick any issue labeled `good first issue` or `help-wanted`.
2. **Create a fork → PR** — follow the commit-style guide in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/avard-org/.github/blob/main/profile/CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. **Join the discussion** — questions, ideas or feedback? Open a discussion thread.

We aim for inclusive, respectful collaboration — see our [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/avard-org/.github/blob/main/profile/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
